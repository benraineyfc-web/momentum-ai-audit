The 5-minute automation audit you can do right now.

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}},

Here's a practical exercise we give every new client. It takes 5 minutes and it'll change how you think about your daily work.

THE "IF / THEN / EVERY" TEST

Grab a piece of paper (or open a note on your phone). Think about your last working day. Write down every task that fits this pattern:

IF [something happens]
THEN [I do this same thing]
EVERY [time / day / week]

Examples:

- IF a new enquiry comes in THEN I add them to a spreadsheet and send a welcome email EVERY time

- IF it's Monday morning THEN I pull together last week's sales numbers into a report EVERY week

- IF a project is completed THEN I send the invoice and update the project tracker EVERY time

- IF a customer asks about delivery times THEN I look it up and reply with the same info EVERY day


THE RULE OF THUMB:

If a task follows an IF/THEN/EVERY pattern, it can almost certainly be automated. Most business owners who do this exercise find 8-15 automatable tasks in a single day. That's hours of work that doesn't need a human.

Try it. You might be surprised how much of your day is spent on autopilot tasks that actual autopilot could handle.
