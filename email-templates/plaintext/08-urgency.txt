Subject: Honest question, {{FIRST_NAME}}: what's the cost of waiting?
Preview: UK SME automation adoption grew 340% last year. Here's why waiting has a real price tag.

Let's be straight with you.

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}},

We're not going to pretend that a countdown timer and "ONLY 3 SPOTS LEFT!!!" is going to make you act. You're a business owner, not easily spooked.

But here's what we are going to tell you, because it's true:

340% increase in UK SME automation adoption over the past 12 months.

That's not a made-up number to scare you. That's what we're seeing across our own client base and the broader market. Businesses your size, in your sector, are actively automating their operations. Right now.

Here's what that means practically:

- Your competitors are responding to leads faster than you
- They're operating with lower overheads on the same revenue
- They're freeing up their team to focus on growth while admin runs itself

Every month you wait is another month of manual work that didn't need to happen. That's a real cost, even if it doesn't show up on a bill.


A GENUINE NOTE ON CAPACITY

We're a small, hands-on team. We don't churn out cookie-cutter solutions. Every automation we build is custom to the business. That means we take on a limited number of new clients each month to keep the quality high. We're not trying to manufacture urgency. We're just telling you how it works. If you're interested, sooner is better than later for getting into the schedule.


Your report is ready. Your roadmap is clear. The only missing piece is a conversation.
