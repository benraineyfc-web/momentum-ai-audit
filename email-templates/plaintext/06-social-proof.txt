Don't take our word for it.

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}},

We can talk about automation all day. But you probably want to hear from people who've actually done it. Here's what a few of our clients have to say:


"We were spending 2 full days a week just processing orders and updating spreadsheets. bizflow automated the entire thing in about three weeks. Now it takes 20 minutes. I wish I'd done this a year ago."

— Sarah K., Founder, Mosaic Home (e-commerce, 8 staff)
Results: 14 hrs/week saved | £1,800/month saved


"I was sceptical. I thought AI was just a buzzword. But they showed me exactly where I was wasting time and built automations that genuinely work. Our response time to new leads went from 4 hours to under 5 minutes."

— James T., Director, Apex Property Services (property management, 22 staff)
Results: Lead response 4hrs to 5min | 31% more conversions


"The ROI was obvious within the first month. They automated our client onboarding, invoicing follow-ups, and reporting. My ops manager said it felt like hiring two new people."

— Lisa M., Managing Director, Clearview Accounting (accountancy practice, 15 staff)
Results: ROI in 4 weeks | £3,200/month saved


These are normal UK businesses. Not tech companies. Not enterprises. Just owners who decided to stop doing things the hard way.
