# Brand Name Options — AI Audit Business

*10 options across 3 categories. Domain availability checked via DNS: February 2026.*

**Note:** DNS "no A record" strongly suggests availability but should be confirmed at a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, or 123 Reg) before purchasing. Some domains may be parked or reserved without an A record.

## Category 1: Professional / Corporate (3 options)

---

### Option 1: Gridline AI

**Positioning:** "We map the lines between where your business is and where AI can take it."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| gridlineai.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| gridlineai.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| gridlineai.io | Likely available (no A record) |

**Strategic Reasoning:** "Gridline" evokes structure, precision, and mapping — perfect for an audit business that maps opportunities and risks. It's distinctive without being try-hard. Sounds established from day one.

**Visual Direction:** Clean geometric grid patterns, structured layouts. Colour: Deep navy (#0F172A) + electric cyan (#06B6D4). Typography: Inter or Satoshi (bold, geometric). Logo: Abstract grid/line icon.

**Pros:**
- All three key domains appear available
- Distinctive — no major brand conflicts identified
- Scales beyond audits (Gridline AI could offer anything)
- Sounds professional in a DM: "Hey, I run Gridline AI — we help businesses..."
- Strong trademark potential

**Cons:**
- Slight fintech association (Gridline is a fintech platform, but different space)
- "Gridline" alone doesn't scream AI audit — needs "AI" suffix
- Slightly cold/corporate for a founder-led brand

**Scale Potential:** High — works for audits, automation builds, retainers, security, and SaaS/platform.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run Gridline AI — we help businesses find where AI saves them time and money."

---

### Option 2: Northpoint AI

**Positioning:** "Your north star for AI transformation."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| northpointai.co.uk | TAKEN (has A record: 84.32.84.32) |
| northpointai.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| northpointai.io | TAKEN (has A record: 216.198.79.1) |

**Strategic Reasoning:** "North point" = direction, guidance, navigation. Perfect for a business that gives companies a clear direction on AI. Has a premium, consultancy feel.

**Visual Direction:** Compass/navigation motif. Colour: Midnight blue (#1E293B) + gold accent (#F59E0B). Typography: Manrope or Plus Jakarta Sans. Logo: Abstract compass point or arrow.

**Pros:**
- Strong directional metaphor
- Feels premium and consultancy-grade
- Good in conversation: "We're Northpoint AI — we show businesses exactly where AI fits"
- Scales well into CAIO retainers and enterprise

**Cons:**
- .co.uk is TAKEN — would need to buy from current holder or use alternative TLD
- .io also taken — only .ai appears available
- "Northpoint" used by various IT/finance companies (though not in AI audit specifically)
- Without .co.uk, harder to establish UK credibility

**Scale Potential:** High — premium name that works across all service tiers.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run Northpoint AI — we audit businesses and show them exactly where AI saves time and money."

---

### Option 3: Baseline AI

**Positioning:** "Know your baseline. Then beat it."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| baselineai.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| baselineai.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| baselineai.io | Check needed |

**Strategic Reasoning:** "Baseline" is an audit/measurement term — your starting point before improvement. It positions the audit as the essential first step. Technical credibility baked into the name.

**Visual Direction:** Horizontal line motifs, measurement-inspired design. Colour: Charcoal (#18181B) + lime green (#84CC16). Typography: DM Sans or Inter. Logo: Horizontal line with upward arrow.

**Pros:**
- .co.uk and .ai appear available
- Perfect metaphor for audit work (establishing a baseline)
- Technical credibility without jargon
- Sounds sharp in conversation

**Cons:**
- "Baseline" is common in ML/AI contexts — less distinctive
- Could sound too technical for non-tech founders
- Google had a "Baseline" project (discontinued, but adds noise)
- Slightly clinical — may lack warmth for a founder-led brand

**Scale Potential:** Medium-high — works for audits and consulting, slightly less natural for a broader platform play.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run Baseline AI — we benchmark your business and show you exactly where AI makes an impact."

## Category 2: Direct / No-BS (4 options)

### Option 4: ScanStack

**Positioning:** "We scan your business. Stack the wins."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| scanstack.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| scanstack.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| scanstack.io | Likely available (no A record) |

**Strategic Reasoning:** "Scan" = audit/diagnosis. "Stack" = tech stack, building blocks, compounding. Coined name with strong memorability. Feels like a product, not a consultancy.

**Visual Direction:** Layered/stacked visual elements, scanning motif. Colour: Near-black (#0A0A0A) + electric blue (#3B82F6). Typography: Satoshi or Space Grotesk (bold). Logo: Stacked scan lines or layered blocks.

**Pros:**
- ALL THREE key domains appear available
- Coined name — strongest trademark potential of all options
- Sounds like a product (future SaaS potential)
- Memorable and punchy
- Works without "AI" in the name — more flexible

**Cons:**
- Doesn't immediately communicate AI (needs context)
- Could sound like a document scanning tool
- Slightly techy — may need explanation for non-tech audiences
- Two syllables each — "Scan-Stack" is punchy but needs brand building

**Scale Potential:** Very high — works perfectly as a product/SaaS brand. "ScanStack for Business", "ScanStack Pro", "ScanStack Security" all work.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run ScanStack — we scan businesses for AI opportunities and stack up the quick wins."

---

### Option 5: The AI Scanner

**Positioning:** "Your business, scanned for AI opportunities."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| theaiscanner.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| theaiscanner.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| theaiscanner.io | Check needed |

**Strategic Reasoning:** Extremely descriptive — does what it says on the tin. Perfect for a productised audit. No explanation needed. The "The" adds authority.

**Visual Direction:** Scanner/radar motif, clean and bold. Colour: Black (#000000) + vivid orange (#F97316). Typography: Inter (extra bold) or Manrope. Logo: Radar sweep or scanning beam icon.

**Pros:**
- Instantly understood — zero explanation needed
- Perfect for a productised audit: "Get your AI scan"
- Descriptive names work well for SEO
- .co.uk and .ai appear available
- Very natural in DMs: "I run The AI Scanner"

**Cons:**
- Highly descriptive = weak trademark protection
- Harder to scale beyond audits/scanning
- "Scanner" could feel reductive for higher-ticket services
- Multiple apps/tools use "AI Scanner" as features
- The "The" is slightly awkward in URLs

**Scale Potential:** Medium — excellent for the audit product, but may need a rebrand or parent brand for enterprise/retainer work.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run The AI Scanner — we scan your business for hidden AI opportunities and give you a roadmap."

---

### Option 6: AI Audit Co

**Positioning:** "AI audits for businesses that don't have time to waste."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| aiauditco.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| aiauditco.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| aiauditco.io | Check needed |

**Strategic Reasoning:** Straightforward, no-nonsense. "Co" suffix signals a modern, lean operation (a la Glossier, Away, etc.). Tells you exactly what they do.

**Visual Direction:** Clean, minimal, modern startup aesthetic. Colour: White background + charcoal (#1C1917) + accent red (#EF4444). Typography: Plus Jakarta Sans or DM Sans. Logo: Minimal wordmark with "AI" highlighted.

**Pros:**
- Crystal clear positioning
- Domains appear available
- "Co" is trendy and modern
- Perfect for the audit entry product
- SEO-friendly — "AI Audit" is a search term

**Cons:**
- Extremely descriptive — no trademark protection
- Limits the brand to audits (hard to pivot to retainers, builds, platform)
- Sounds generic — doesn't stand out in a crowded market
- "Co" suffix may feel like a trend rather than substance
- Doesn't convey the transformation/results angle

**Scale Potential:** Low-medium — boxed into "audit" positioning. Would need rebranding to expand.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run AI Audit Co — we do one-off AI audits for businesses that want to know where AI can help."

---

### Option 7: OpScan AI

**Positioning:** "We scan your operations. You get the playbook."

| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| opscanai.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| opscanai.ai | Likely available (no A record) |
| opscanai.io | Check needed |

**Strategic Reasoning:** "Op" = operations. "Scan" = audit/diagnosis. Punchy, coined compound. Sounds like a tool. Communicates that this is about operational improvement, not just tech.

**Visual Direction:** Dashboard/diagnostic aesthetic. Colour: Deep slate (#0F172A) + bright green (#22C55E). Typography: Space Grotesk or JetBrains Mono for headers, Inter for body. Logo: Scan/pulse line through "Op" text.

**Pros:**
- All domains appear available
- Coined name — good trademark potential
- "Operations" focus differentiates from pure-tech AI agencies
- Sounds like a product (SaaS potential)
- Short and punchy

**Cons:**
- May need explanation ("What's OpScan?")
- "Op" could be misread as "optional" or confused with other meanings
- Slightly clinical — could lack warmth
- Newer name concept — needs market testing

**Scale Potential:** High — "OpScan AI" works for audits, automation, consulting. "OpScan Security", "OpScan Platform" all viable.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run OpScan AI — we scan your operations for AI opportunities and hand you the playbook."

| bizboostai.ai | TAKEN (has A record) |
| bizboostai.io | Check needed |

**Strategic Reasoning:** The founder liked this name. Direct, energetic, SME-friendly. Clearly communicates value — AI that boosts your business. Accessible to non-tech audiences.

**Visual Direction:** Bold, energetic, upward-motion design. Colour: Navy (#1E3A5F) + warm amber (#F59E0B). Typography: Manrope (bold) or Poppins. Logo: Upward arrow or rocket motif.

**Pros:**
- Immediately understood
- Energetic and positive
- Non-threatening for AI-nervous businesses
- Founder already likes it
- .co.uk appears available

**Cons:**
- .ai domain is TAKEN
- Sounds more like an SME marketing tool than a professional audit service
- "Biz" can feel informal — may struggle at enterprise level
- "Boost" is overused in business branding
- May not convey the rigour of a proper audit/assessment

**Scale Potential:** Medium — good for the audit and small automation builds, but may feel lightweight for enterprise security audits or CAIO retainers.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run BizBoost AI — we help small businesses find and fix their biggest time-wasters with AI."

---

**Visual Direction:** Industrial-meets-modern. Colour: Steel grey (#374151) + burnt orange (#EA580C). Typography: Satoshi (bold) or Outfit. Logo: Anvil/spark motif, angular shapes.

**Scale Potential:** High — premium name that scales across all services. "Forgepoint Security", "Forgepoint Platform" work well.

**DM Test:** "Hey, I run Forgepoint AI — we audit businesses, find AI opportunities, and build the systems to capture them."

### Option 10: ClearPath AI

|--------|--------|
| clearpathai.co.uk | Likely available (no A record) |
| clearpathai.ai | TAKEN (has A record) |
| clearpathai.io | Check needed |

**Strategic Reasoning:** The founder liked this name. "Clear path" = clarity, direction, removing obstacles. Directly addresses the market problem: businesses don't know where to start with AI.
