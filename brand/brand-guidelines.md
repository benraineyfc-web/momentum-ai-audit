## 4. Voice & Tone Guide

### Brand Voice Principles

**1. Founder-Led & Direct**
- Write like you're talking to a mate over coffee
- No corporate speak, no jargon unless necessary
- Use "I" (Ben's voice), not "we" or "our team"

**2. No-BS, Results-Focused**
- Say what you mean: "Here's what you get" not "Unlock your potential"
- Avoid guru culture, hype, and empty promises
- Lead with tangible outcomes: time saved, money saved, revenue gained

**3. Relatable & Human**
- Acknowledge the overwhelm: "AI feels like a lot. It doesn't have to be."
- No gatekeeping: "You don't need a tech degree for this"
- British humour where appropriate (dry, self-aware, not forced)

**4. British English, UK Market**
- Spelling: Colour, optimise, analyse, centre
- Currency: £ (GBP), not $
- Cultural references: UK-specific (plumbers, care homes, local businesses)

### Writing Examples

**✅ DO:**
- "Here's what you get for £497"
- "I help UK businesses save 10–20hrs/week using AI"
- "No ongoing commitment. No upsells. Just the audit."
- "If you're losing leads because you're slow to respond, AI fixes that"

**❌ DON'T:**
- "Unlock transformational AI synergies"
- "Leverage cutting-edge solutions"
- "Join the AI revolution"
- "Disrupt your industry"

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Landing Page Hero | Bold, direct, problem-focused | "Stop Losing £X,XXX/Month to Problems You Can't See" |
| Emails | Conversational, helpful | "Hi John, got your form — here's what happens next" |
| FAQs | Reassuring, transparent | "No. This isn't a sales pitch. You get a complete roadmap." |
| Social Media | Relatable, educational | "Most SMEs waste 10–20hrs/week on tasks a computer could do. Here's how to fix it." |
| Error Messages | Clear, solutions-focused | "Payment failed. Check your card details and try again." |

### Messaging Hierarchy

**Lead with pain → Show the fix → Make it easy**

1. **Pain:** "You're losing time and money to problems you can't see"
2. **Solution:** "90-minute AI audit shows you exactly where"
3. **Action:** "Book for £497, delivered in 48 hours"

### Banned Words & Phrases

**Never use:**
- "Synergy", "leverage", "disrupt", "game-changing"
- "Unlock your potential", "transform your business"
- "Join the revolution", "cutting-edge AI"
- "Guru", "ninja", "rockstar", "thought leader"

**Use instead:**
- "Fix", "improve", "save", "gain", "find"
- "Here's what you get", "this is how it works"
- "Clear plan", "no jargon", "results in 48 hours"
