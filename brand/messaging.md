## 8. FAQ Messaging (Objection Handling)

### Q: "What if I don't know anything about AI?"
```
Perfect. That's exactly who this is for. I translate the tech into plain English actions—no jargon, no complexity. If you have customers and processes, AI can improve them.
```

### Q: "Is this just a sales pitch for more services?"
```
No. You get a complete roadmap. Implement it yourself, hire anyone, or hire us. There's zero obligation. The audit is useful on its own.
```

### Q: "What if my business is too small?"
```
If you have customers, you have opportunities AI can improve. Most SMEs waste 10–20hrs/week on manual tasks. That's £10k–£13k/year in saved time.
```

### Q: "How is this different from a free ChatGPT session?"
```
This is a structured business diagnosis, not prompt engineering. I map your systems, score your readiness, identify risks, and give you a prioritised action plan.
```

### Q: "Can I see examples of past audits?"
```
I'm building my case study portfolio now—hence the discounted rate for early clients. You'll be one of the first, which is why the price is £497 instead of £997.
```

### Q: "What happens after the audit?"
```
That's up to you. Some clients implement the roadmap themselves. Some hire us to build it. Some do nothing and keep the roadmap for later. No pressure.
```

### Q: "Is £497 worth it?"
```
If we find you 5 hours/week back (conservative), that's £10k–£13k/year in saved time. The audit pays for itself in week one. Plus, you get the revenue upside from faster lead response and better systems.
```

## 9. Problem Statements (Landing Page "Problem" Section)

### Problem 1: Manual Processes
**Headline:** "Manual Processes Eating 10–20+ Hours/Week"

**Body:**
Every hour spent on repetitive admin is an hour not spent growing your business. If you're doing tasks a computer could handle, you're paying the "manual tax" every single week.

### Problem 2: Lead Loss
**Headline:** "Leads Falling Through Cracks"

**Body:**
Slow response times kill conversions. If you're not responding to leads within minutes, they're booking with competitors who are.

### Problem 3: AI Gap
**Headline:** "Competitors Using AI While You're Stuck in Spreadsheets"

**Body:**
Your competitors are automating lead capture, follow-ups, and customer onboarding. Every day you wait is a day they're pulling ahead.

---

## 10. Content Themes (Social Media/Email)

**Core Themes to Repeat:**
1. Time waste → "Most SMEs lose 10–20hrs/week to manual processes"
2. Lead response → "If you're not responding in minutes, competitors are"
3. AI accessibility → "You don't need a tech degree. You need a plan."
4. Cost of inaction → "Every week you wait costs £X in lost time"
5. No-BS clarity → "No jargon. No hype. Just the roadmap."

**Content Angles:**
- Educational: "Here's what AI can actually do for [industry]"
- Diagnostic: "5 signs you're losing money to manual processes"
- Case study: "How we saved [client] 15hrs/week"
- Behind-the-scenes: "What happens in a 90-minute AI audit"
- Objection handling: "Too expensive? Here's the ROI breakdown"
